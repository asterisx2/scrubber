# Scrubber - A recipe for scaffolding legacy html code into angular templates

## To run, clone the project and open main.html / index.html

## Features

- Cleansizes legacy html by stripping out extra HTML, attributes on am HTML node among other things to create a template you can use directly in your components

- Upgrades bootstrap classes if the page is using older versions of bootstrap, this helps you save some time in writing styling yourself.

- Replaces HTML with custom components such as ```select``` to ```app-select```, table to ```app-grid```. This can be configured inside config.js. You can also do much more powerful mapping for components by using the key creator, check ```How it works```

## How to use
**It is recommended to check the ```How it works``` section first before proceeding**
- To create template from legacy, follow the following steps:
1. Copy the source html inside your browser, in chrome you can go to developer tools, select the HTML node and right click to select Copy > Copy Element
2. Open index.html, select converter by clicking on the top left ```Converter``` button, paste the HTML inside the left box and click on convert button.
3. Your template will appear inside the right box, click on the top left ```Copy``` button to copy it.

- To create a key for an HTML node, follow the following steps: 
1. Copy the source html inside your browser, in chrome you can go to developer tools, select the HTML node and right click to select Copy > Copy Element
2. Open index.html, select Key Converter by clicking on the top left ```Key Convert``` button, paste the HTML inside the left box and click on ```Generate Key``` button.
3. Your key will appear inside the right box, click on the top left ```Copy``` button to copy it.

## How it works

### There are three main parts of the page

- Converter (Inside index.html) - The page where you paste the legacy html inside the left textarea and click the convert button to get a template.

- Key Creator (Inside index.html) - Creates a key for a HTML node. This is used as a 'hash/key' to map HTML to df-components. This can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be. The mapping is generated automatically but **YOU MAY NEED TO MODIFY TO MAKE IT AS SUCCINT AS POSSIBLE BY MODIFYING THE GENERATED VALUE** otherwise it will fail to match the correct HTML node if it has more information then needed. The logic works by comparing attributes and to check if all the values inside an attribute match the node, if you have more than required this test will fail.

- The Config file. This is the main gist of the tool. The config file is a collection of mappings such as this one:

```
'div::id="mainLeaderboard"::style="overflow:hidden;"': {
   component: 'df-panel',
   upgradeBootstrap: false,
   buildChildren: false,
   keepAttributes: ['onclick'],
   keepAttributesWithValue: ['ondblclick'],
},
  
 ```
 
 What this tells the tool is 'Hey whenever you encounter a div with ```id``` ```mainLeaderboard``` and an attribute ```style``` with value ```overflow:hidden;``` go ahead and do the following
 
 1. Inject the node inside the ```component``` field, df-panel in this case inside the template in its place,
 2. Don't upgrade its bootstrap if it has any. (```upgradeBootstrap: false```)
 3. Do not build its children. (```buildChidren: false```)
 4. Keep certain attributes but not their value, via ```keepAttributes``` array
 5. Keep certain attributes and also their value, via ```keepAttributesWithValue``` array, in this case we are keeping the 'ondblclick' value
 6. There is an additional field called ```func```. In cases where more needs to be done then is possible by the above fields, you can pass a function which will recieve the node itself. Here is an example of that:
 ```
  'option': {
    upgradeBootstrap: false,
    buildChildren: false,
    keepAttributes: [],
    keepAttributesWithValue: [],
    func: function(node) {
      return htmlToElement('<df-option value="' + node.innerText + '" ' + 'displayText="'+ node.innerText + '"></df-option>');
    }
   ```
**The config file will most likely be different for different projects and will keep on growing as you start progressing on the project, there is an uptake in beginning as new mappings are to be created for the custom components unique to the project, but its pretty straightforward and takes insignificant time**
